    <p>Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to
      his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the
      Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches
      with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season.
      Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13
      season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the
      first 21 seasons of the Premier League</p>
